# CoffeeMeetsBagelProject
A project I did for Coffee Meets Bagel that they really liked &amp; is a good example of my most up to date coding style &amp; practices. It comes with a nice table view that has a gradient layer as a background that changes as you scroll &amp; a cool transition to the detail view using the team members profile image. (CMB extended an offer to another candidate the day I got to submit this)
